            After that, unpack the distribution. You need to make sure 
            $DIST/perl/site is in the mod_perl include path. Next create
            an alias for $DIST/perl/site/cgi, and make sure all files except
            for those ending with .css are handled by mod_perl. Then, make sure
            that Apache serves index.cgi files as the default handler for
            their directories for Zavitan's sub-tree.

                are several constants that need to be set. Search for SET ME

                Create a crypt file (in the path specified in Config.pm) and 
                place there 56 bytes of random data. The following command will
                work on Linux:

            <title>Initializing the Database</title>
            <para>
                Create a MySQL database that the user specified in Config.pm 
                have full read and write permissions to. Fill the database using
                <filename>$DIST/site/sql/create_tables.sql</filename>. This 
                will create a default super-user named root with password root.

        <section id="web">
            <title>Logging to the Web Interface</title>
            <para>
                Access the site's URL and access the admin link. Log in as root,
                with password root. (make sure you change the password 
                afterwards). Now, you can start adding clubs and users and set
                up the system.

        <title>Basic Operation Concepts</title>
        <para>
            The system manages several clubs, and several users. A user may
            be a super-admin, in which case he can edit users and edit
            the clubs' data as he pleases. If not, he is restricted to editing
            the data of the clubs to which he has permissions to.
        </para>
        <para>
            For each club, there are three levels of usability by a non
            super-admin user. Either that user may not do anything with the 
            club; or he can add or edit seminars, but not manage the subjects
            list; lastly, it is possible that he can also manage the list
            of subjects that are associated with that specific club.
        </para>
        <para>
            When a seminar is created, it is owned by the club that created
            it under one of its subjects. This seminar can then be associated
            with other subjects, including those of other clubs. Alternatively,
            it can be disassociated from subjects it had been associated with
            previously.
        </para>
        <para>
            Seminars may not be deleted, but non-associated are not
            displayed to the general public.
