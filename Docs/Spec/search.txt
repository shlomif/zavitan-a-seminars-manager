* By date-range : start date - end date.

* By Club/Subject

* By keywords from title/description

* By lecturer

Implementation:
---------------

date range: SQL's >= and <= operators

subject: SQL's IN operator

keywords: (((Title LIKE '%keyword1%') AND (Title LIKE '%keyword2%')) OR
          ((Description LIKE '%keyword1%') AND (Description LIKE '%keyword2%')))

lecturer: (LOWER(Lecturer)) LIKE '%$lecturer_string%')

Note: It is MySQL specific, but we can use MATCH for Full-Text Search.
