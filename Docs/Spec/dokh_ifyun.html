        <h3>Project's Purpose</h3>

        <p>
        The purpose of the project is to create a WWW-based site to keep track
        and publish Technion seminars. All visitors will be able to see a
        calendar of seminars, and to search for them according to various
        parameters. There would also be several administrators who can add
        such Seminars and edit them. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Seminars will be divided among several clubs, and each club will have
        a different set of administrators. The site will also have a site-wide
        administrator, who can set the other admins' permissions and add
        new clubs.
        </p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <p>
        We already have a Linux workstation that we can work on. Aside
        from that we will need a permanent demo server, on which we can put
        a 24 hr/day demo site, which users can experience with. We also
        require a CVS server on which we can store the various versions
        of our work.
