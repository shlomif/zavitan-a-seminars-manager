Every seminar is owned by a certain subject. (and evidently a club). A club
owner may choose to associate it with other subjects, not necessarily of
the same club. The seminar may also be disassociated from such subjects.

Nevertheless, only the owner club may edit the seminar.

In each club we will display first the owned seminars, then the associated
ones. For each seminar, there will be a link to a separate page that
edits the associated subjects within a club.

A non-club owner may view a different club and there decide to associate
a seminar with a subject of his own clubs. 

In the "New Seminar" form, there will be a choice of the primary subject of
the seminar, from within the subjects of the club in the URL.
