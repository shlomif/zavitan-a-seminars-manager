H2: Class Structure:
====================

H3: Site Organizer:
-------------------

Contains a tree of the site. Knows how to get from the current location 
to the central resource of the site that are embodied in the menus.

H3: Master Page Manager:
------------------------

Displays the master page (with the menus, the logo, footer, etc.) and delegates
a request to the page-specific object.

There are several modes of it depending on regular user/club admin/site-wide 
admin.

H3: Form Pre-Processor:
-----------------------

A generic class that receives:

1. A data structure that describes the elements processed by the form and 
the sanity checks that should be performed on them.
2. The Form CGI Parameters.
3. Authentication Parameters.
4. TBD.

It performs the sanity checks, and makes sure that everything is in order.
It returns OK or a listing of errors (as a { field, what's wrong} tuple).
