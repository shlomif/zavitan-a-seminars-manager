1. CVS
    - The de-facto standard in the Open-Source World
    - Works OK, and relatively flawlessly.
    - Has many limitations, some very basic.
    - Fully O-S, and free to use.

2. BitKeeper
    - A very complete and professional source control system.
    - Aims to be a replacement for CVS, ClearCase, and anything else
    in use today.
    - Requires that either we:
        1. Send the change logs to the main server. (at real time)
        2. Pay some money to make sure we don't have to do it.
            a) Light version that costs less money but has less features.
            b) Full version that costs more.
           
            - The license is "Per seat" and costs $400 to $800 for the
            lightweight version and $1000 to $2400 for the commercial one.

3. Arch
    http://www.regexps.com/#arch
    - Open-Source.
    - Complete (?)
    - Developed on FreeBSD but should (!) be portable to other UNIX 
    platforms.
    - No Windows support (even on the client side).

4. Subversion
    http://subversion.tigris.org/
    - Incomplete and under heavy development
    - May or may not work properly.
    - Open-Source
    - Aims to be a better CVS, but not much more than that, at
    least not for the forseeable future. (i.e: it is not a ClearCase or 
    BitKeeper replacement)
    - Has very few day-to-day idiosincrecies.
    - Operation is mostly backward compatible with CVS

5. Aegis - 
    http://aegis.sourceforge.net/
    - Complete and Stable.
    - Open-Source
    - UNIX only
