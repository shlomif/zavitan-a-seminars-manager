<subject "Freecell Solver's Features List" />

<h2>Usability Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>
The stacks and freecells retain their position throughout the 
presented solution.
</li>

<li>
Can present either the intermediate states (stepping at one move or sequence
move) or the moves that are required for the solution.
</li>

<li>
On UNIX: accepts some user signal combinations that turn some run-time 
debugging information on and off.
</li>

<li>
Some configurations are very fast: can solve the Microsoft 32,000 in 22 
minutes on a Pentium III 667 MHz machine.
</li>

<li>
Option to use atomic moves which guarantee an accurate verdict. 
(non-atomic scans may report a false negative)
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Available as a library for use within third-party applications. The license
is Public Domain, which means it can be used without any restrictions 
everywhere.
</li>

<li>
The core library and program is written entirely in a portable ANSI C code.
</li>

<li>
Compile-Time option for using either states of flat stacks ("Compact States")
and states in which the stacks are stored as pointers, while each stack
formation is allocated only once. The former is faster, but the latter
consumes less memory.
</li>

<li>
Full compatiblity between dynamically-linked third-party applications to the 
version of the library that is used.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scan Options</h2>

<ul>

<li>
Supports the DFS (= Depth-First Search), Randomized DFS and A* scans. 
Which one can be specified at run-time.
</li>

<li>
The order of the tests to be conducted on a given state can be specified at
the beginning of the scan. It is also possible to include only a subset of
the available tests.
</li>

<li>
With the A* scan, one can specify the weights of the different state 
evalutaion parameters.
</li>

<li>
One can limit the scan to a certain number of checked states.
</li>

<li>
It is possible to resume a scan from a pre-empted position.
</li>

<li>
After a solution path was found it can be optimized using a BFS 
(= Breadth-First Search) scan on the intermediate states.
</li>

<li>
There is an option to reparent states during a scan if their depth in 
the solution tree is higher than the one with which they were reached. This
also tends to shorten the solution length.
</li>

<li>
The Randomized DFS scan accepts a user-defined seed.
</li>

<li>
Several scans can be played on the same states' collection (while switching
from scan to scan) giving on average a faster solving time.
</li>

<li>
It is possible to specify a static prelude of quotas to be played before the 
perpetual loop.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Game Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Can solve games whose sequences are built by suit, by alternate colour or
by rank regardless of colour.
</li>

<li>
Can solve games whose sequence move is limited by the number of Freecells,
or unlimited.
</li>

<li>
Can solve games whose vacant stacks can be filled by any card, by kings
only, or by no card whatsoever.
</li>

<li>
Run-time choice of the number of Freecells and Stacks. 
(limited by a compile-time directive)
</li>

<li>
Supports games of one and two decks.
</li>
