<br />
This is Freecell Solver - a program that automatically solves games of 
Freecell and similar Solitaire variants such as Eight Off, Forecell and
Seahaven Towers, as well as Simple Simon boards. Freecell Solver is free 
software distributed under the public domain. It is written in ANSI C 
and requires a C compiler to be built.  Nevertheless, binaries for 
Windows 32-bit are available.<br />

<br />

Included with the archive is source code for programs that can automatically 
feed it with the boards of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> Freecell 
, GNOME AisleRiot's Freecell board, 
<a href="http://pysol.tsx.org/">PySol</a>'s boards,
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Freecell</a>, or
<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fomalhaut/fcpro.html">Freecell Pro</a>.<br />

<br />

Freecell Solver can also be built as a library for use within your own
Solitaire implementations. A more detailed list of features can be found
in the <a href="features.html"><b>Features List</b></a>.<br />

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>12-Jul-2002</h3>

<p>
Freecell Solver 2.6.0 has been spotted in the wild. This version features 
atomic moves, which are slower than the traditional ones, but guarantee 
a true verdict. It also has a <tt>--prelude</tt> switch that allows running
a static order of quotas at start for the participating soft threads, and
makes constructing faster solving presets easier.
</p>

<p>
Several other flags were added, and the code has also been greatly optimized 
and cleaned up, which makes Freecell Solver much faster than it was before.
</p>

<h3>29-Mar-2002</h3>

<p>
Freecell Solver 2.4.0 was released. The highlight of this release is the 
ability for several scans to operate on the same state collection. This is
done using a mechanism called "soft threads", which is switched in user-land 
and does not require system multi-threading.
</p>


<h3>18-Feb-2002</h3>

<p>
Freecell Solver 2.2.0 came into the world today. This release features
several improvements and fixes to the library's internals - it now resides
solely in the "freecell_solver_" namespace, has a more robust state output, 
and has a simplified and more modular scans' code. Aside from that, the 
maintainance of the package became more integrated and now it is
possible to build an RPM by typing executing rpm -ta on the archive.
</p>

<h3>19-Dec-2001</h3>

<p>
Freecell Solver 2.0.0 was released. This version features a lot of new 
enhancements and additions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Added some presets for Beleaguered Castle, Citadel and Streets and
Alleys.</li>
<li>Re-factoring of the scans code to make it simpler.</li>
<li>Added many functions to the programmer's library.</li>
<li>fc-solve now uses it, so it is fully independant of the library it is
linked against.</li>
<li>Added a randomized DFS scan (with a user-defined seed).</li>
<li>Win32 Makefile can now generate a working DLL</li>
<li>Most importantly : a new initial digit! All hail the "2"!!</li>
</ol>

<h3>2-Oct-2001</h3>

<p>
Freecell Solver version 1.10.0 was released. This version can now solve
deals of Simple Simon, as well as solving all the Freecell-like variants
that it could before.
</p>

<h3>31-Aug-2001</h3>

<p>
Freecell Solver version 1.8.0 was released into the world. Its main
highlight is its new building process based on GNU Autotools. Now, one
can build a shared library, a static library and an executable across
many UNIX variants out of the box.
</p>

<p>
I also adapted the GNOME AisleRiot board generation program to generate
the boards of the new Solitaire variants that were added to it and are 
supported by Freecell Solver.
</p>

<h3>11-Apr-2001</h3>

<p>
Freecell Solver version 1.6.0 has been released. It supports a solution path
optimization routine which enables it to generate solutions that contain a 
smaller number of moves. Furthermore, there are some optimizations, so it 
should be at least a little faster.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, a lot of comments were added to the code, to make it easier 
for interested developers to understand it.
</p>
